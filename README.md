# Archie-nico-ver - Hugo theme
Archie-nico-ver is a minimal but poppy theme for Hugo.

## Demo
This theme is live at my personal blog: https://nico-series.github.io/

## Installation
Generic Hugo installation instructions are available here:
- General Installation: https://gohugo.io/installation/
- Quick Start: https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/
- Hosting via GitHub Pages: https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/

However, if you plan on making modifications (or could possibly end up disliking the direction I take this), I recommend deviating from the above when you get to the theming steps and following [Andrew Hoog's](https://github.com/ahoog42) instructions, as they encourage forking the theme so that you can modify it without issue: https://www.andrewhoog.com/post/git-submodule-for-hugo-themes/

### TL;DR 
1. Set up a base Hugo project with no theme.
2. Fork this repo and rename it something excellent.
3. Create a `themes` folder in your hugo project.
4. Clone your fork into the themes folder.
5. In your `hugo.toml` file, add the following _but with your fork's name_: `theme = 'archie-nico-ver'`
